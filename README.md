# NoHackCore
This is an OpenCore configuration intended for non-hackintosh use cases.

This config has been cleaned up and tweaked to have no quirks, patches and NVRAM variables that are useless for computers that are running other operating systems rather than macOS.

## What's the point?
Well, some users want to customize their system a little bit, like getting a Mac-style boot menu or adding a boot chime for example, or even replacing the good ol' unreliable GRUB2 bootloader in some multiboot systems...
Besides that, I don't even know. :P

## How to install
Right now this config is in an unfinished state. I will write a guide on how to set it up sooner or later!
